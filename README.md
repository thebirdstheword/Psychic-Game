This Psychic Game has you guess what letter the computer has chosen. If you cannot guess the correct letter in nine guesses, you lose and the game starts over.

Technologies used: 
Javascript
HTML

Looking forward: I would like to format this so that it has more pizzaz. As-is, the functionality is all there but it isn't particularly aesthetically pleasing
